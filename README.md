#### Development
### System Requirements and Setup
# XCode
A Mac running macOS Big Sur 11.0 or later.
At least 8GB of RAM, but 16GB or more is recommended.
At least 15GB of available disk space, but 50GB or more is recommended.
Xcode 13 or later, which can be downloaded for free from the Mac App Store or from the Apple Developer website.

# Operating System
To run an Xcode project on an iOS, iPadOS, tvOS, watchOS... device, you will need:

A Mac computer running macOS operating system. Xcode installed on the Mac computer. Xcode is an integrated development environment (IDE) that allows developers to create, debug, and test their iOS, iPadOS, tvOS, and watchOS applications. A valid Apple Developer account that allows you to sign the app with a distribution certificate and provisioning profile. You will need to create a certificate and a profile for your app in the Apple Developer portal. The correct target selected in the Xcode project. You can select the target from the dropdown menu next to the scheme in the Xcode toolbar.
A valid code signing identity for the selected target. You can select the code signing identity from the project settings. A valid provisioning profile for the selected target. You can select the provisioning profile from the project settings.
Any additional dependencies or frameworks required by the Xcode project.

Once you have all the necessary requirements, you can build and run the Xcode project on your device by selecting the "Run" command from the Xcode toolbar. The app will be compiled, signed, and installed on your device for testing.

## Installing Other Required Packages
# OpenAI API
To access the OpenAI API, you need to follow these steps:

Create an OpenAI account: Go to the OpenAI website (https://openai.com/) and create an account.

Generate API key: Once you have created an account, go to the API keys section of the OpenAI dashboard (https://beta.openai.com/dashboard/api-keys). Click on the "Generate New Key" button and give a name to the key.

Choose the API endpoint: OpenAI offers several APIs for different purposes. Choose the API endpoint that best suits your needs. You can find a list of OpenAI APIs on the OpenAI website.

Install an API client: To use the OpenAI API, you need an API client. OpenAI provides API clients for several programming languages, including Python, Java, and JavaScript. Install the API client for your preferred language.

Use the API: Once you have installed the API client, you can use it to interact with the OpenAI API. The API client provides functions to send requests to the OpenAI API endpoints and receive responses.


# SwiftUI
You can download the latest version of Swift from the official Swift website: https://swift.org/download/

On the website, you'll see different download options depending on your platform (macOS, Ubuntu, etc.). Select the appropriate option for your system and follow the installation instructions.

For macOS, you can download the Swift toolchain package, which includes the Swift compiler, libraries, and REPL. Once you've downloaded the package, double-click it to extract its contents, then drag the Swift folder to your Applications directory.

You can also download Xcode, which includes the Swift compiler and other development tools. Xcode is available on the Mac App Store. Once you've installed Xcode, you can start using Swift by creating a new Swift project or playground.

# UIKit
UIKit is a built-in framework in iOS and is included with Xcode. To start using UIKit in your iOS app, follow these steps:

Open Xcode on your Mac.
Create a new project or open an existing project.
In the left-hand panel, click on the project file to open the project settings.
Click on the "General" tab and scroll down to the "Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content" section.
Click on the "+" button and select "UIKit.framework" from the list of available frameworks.
Choose whether you want to link the framework "Embed & Sign" or "Do Not Embed".
Click "Finish" to add the framework to your project.

Once you have added the UIKit framework to your project, you can start using its classes and methods in your code. Make sure to import the UIKit module in any Swift file where you want to use it:

# MapKit
MapKit is a framework provided by Apple and is included in Xcode. Therefore, to use MapKit, you don't need to download or install it separately. You only need to have Xcode installed on your Mac.

Steps to get started with MapKit in Xcode:

Open Xcode on your Mac.
Click on "Create a new Xcode project".
Select "App" under the "iOS" tab on the left-hand side of the screen.
Choose the template you want to use, such as "Single View App" or "Tabbed App".
Click "Next" and give your project a name and a location to save it.
Choose the language as "Swift" from the options given.
Click "Next" and then "Create".
Once your project is created, you can start using MapKit by adding it to your project. To add MapKit, click on your project in the Project navigator and select your app target. Under the "General" tab, scroll down to the "Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content" section, click the "+" button, and search for "MapKit". Select it and click "Add".
You can now start using MapKit in your project by importing it in your code and using its classes and functions.
Note: MapKit requires that your app has a valid Apple Developer Program account and a Maps API key. You can get an API key from the Apple Developer website and add it to your app's Info.plist file.
